# Burst - Contribution Guidelines
Burst is an open-source project, and we appreciate all contributions that are
submitted by the open-source community.

That being said, before you submit a contribution, we ask that you review the
following:

 - All contributions to Burst (in any form), shall conform to the guidelines
 documented in the "[General Contributions](#general-contributions)" section.
 - All contributions to any of Burst's repositories, will be ignored if they
 fail to conform to the guidelines documented in the
 "[Repository Contributions](#repository-contributions)" section.
 - The Burst team reserves the right to deny any code contributions that do not
 conform to the guidelines documented in the
 "[Code Contributions](#code-contributions)" section.

Any contributions that fail to conform to the guidelines specified in this
document, **can (*and probably will*) be denied**.

## General Contributions
Contributions are to be written using the English language. Use of text-speak,
leet-speak, and other "slang-languages", should be avoided.
