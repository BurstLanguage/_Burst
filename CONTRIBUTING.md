# Burst - Contribution Guidelines
Burst is an open-source project, and we appreciate all contributions that are
submitted by the open-source community.

That being said, before you submit a contribution, we ask that you review the
following:

 - All contributions to Burst (in any form), shall conform to the guidelines
 documented in the "[General Contributions](#general-contributions)" section.
 - All contributions to any of Burst's repositories, will be ignored if they
 fail to conform to the guidelines documented in the
 "[Repository Contributions](#repository-contributions)" section.
 - The Burst team reserves the right to deny any code contributions that do not
 conform to the guidelines documented in the
 "[Code Contributions](#code-contributions)" section.

Any contributions that fail to conform to the guidelines specified in this
document, **can (*and probably will*) be denied**.

## General Contributions
Contributions are to be written using the English language. Use of text-speak,
leet-speak, and other "slang-languages", should be avoided.

## Repository Contributions
### Bug Reports
If you've encountered a problem with Burst or any of its related projects,
please open an issue **on the repository for the project that you encountered a
problem with**.

When submitting bug reports to any of Burst's repositories, please include
detailed information about the problem you encountered, as well as any steps we
could use to reproduce the problem.

### Pull Requests
Whenever you get ready to make a change to a Burst project, please do your best
to **create a new branch for (each of) your change**. Once you're done making a
change, open a pull request, and request to merge your change's branch, with the
original project's main branch (usually "master").

When opening your pull request, please include a detailed overview of your
change (or changes). This makes it easier for the Burst team to review
everything.
