# Burst
*An open-source, C-like language*.

## Project Goals
### 100% Free and Open-Source
Not only should this project be free as in free-speech, this project should also
be free as in free-beer.

It is my hope that this project also be 100% Open-Source, meaning the source
code for every single piece, will be publicly available.

### Self-Hosted Language
In the future, I'd like to be able to use the Burst language, to write the Burst
language. Doing so, would provide us with a real-world example of a program
written using Burst.
